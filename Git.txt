git questions
-------------
1>What is the command to write a commit message in Git?
  --->git commit -m "message"
2>How will you squash the last N commits into a single commit?

3>In Git how do you revert a commit that has already been pushed and made public?

4>What is the difference between git pull and git fetch?
-->git pull-downloads the changes in the remote repositories and merge those changes and store them in the local repositories.

5>why do we use git init?
  Most other Git commands are not available outside of an initialized repository, so this is usually the first command you'll run in a new project. Executing git init creates a . git   subdirectory in the current working directory, which contains all of the necessary Git metadata for the new repository.
